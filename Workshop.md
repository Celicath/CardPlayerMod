[h1] Main Mechanics: Poker Cards [/h1]
Out of 80 draftable cards, 40 of them are Poker Card. "Poker" is a new card type with Suit and Rank.
which draws 1 card when played.
At the end of your turn, you enter a phase called "Showdown", where you get the effects from Poker cards in your hand.
Depending on what [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands]Poker Hand[/url] you score, the effects become stronger!
(If you have more than 5 Poker cards in hand, you have to discard down to 5 cards.)

[h1] Balance and Banned contents [/h1]
Because of how Poker cards are played, several relics/cards are not available if you play as the Poker Player for being too overpowered or confusing. 
- Relics: Snecko Eye, Centennial Puzzle, Runic Pyramid, Bag of Preparation, Pocketwatch, Gremlin Horn, Pandora's Box, Unceasing Top, Dead Branch
- Card: Deep Breath, Impatience, Master of Strategy, Mayhem, Magnetism, Violence
- Potion: Swift Potion
- 2 Events, Vampires(?) and Ancient Writings have different choices for the Poker Player.

If you play this with other content mods, some of them might be unbalanced to play with the Poker Player. However I don't want to fix or ban others' work, so just have fun with them!

[h1] Other [/h1]
I recommend enabling "Display summed up damage in gold" in the settings.
