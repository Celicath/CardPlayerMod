[h1] Main Mechanics: Poker Cards [/h1]
40 Poker cards can be put into your deck. "Poker" is a new card type with Suit and Rank.
- Suit: Diamond, Spade, Club, Heart
- Rank: 1 to 10
When you play a Poker card, it just draws 1 card.

At the end of your turn, you enter a phase called "Showdown", where you get the effects from Poker cards in your hand.
Depending on what [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands]Poker Hand[/url] you score, the effects become stronger!
(If you have more than 5 Poker cards in hand, you have to discard down to 5 cards.)

[h1] Balance and Banned contents [/h1]
Because of how Poker cards are played, several relics/cards are not available if you play as the Poker Player for being too overpowered or confusing. 
- Relics: Snecko Eye, Centennial Puzzle, Runic Pyramid, Bag of Preparation, Pocketwatch, Gremlin Horn, Pandora's Box, Unceasing Top, Dead Branch
- Card: Deep Breath, Impatience, Master of Strategy, Mayhem, Magnetism, Violence
- Potion: Swift Potion
- 2 Events, Vampires(?) and Ancient Writings have different choices for the Poker Player.

Banning contents can be turned off in the mod config. (Main menu->Mods->The Poker Player->Config)

Also, if you play this with other content mods, some of them might be unbalanced to play with the Poker Player. However I don't want to fix or ban others' work, so just have fun with them!

[h1] Other [/h1]
I recommend enabling "Display summed up damage in gold" in the settings.
