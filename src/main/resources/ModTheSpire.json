  "description": "Adds a character called The Poker Player, who fights with his own rule inspired from poker.\n\n- Adds 87 cards and 13 relics.\n- Disables some base game contents which are unbalanced or confusing to the Poker Player. If you don't like this behavior, check out the mod config.\n\nv1.0.4 (2020-05-16)\n- Wild Card can no longer pick Hearts\n- You can no longer open Poker Manual on Heart Kill. This is to prevent recording duplicate run history.\n- Poker Manual icon is properly removed (rather than invisible) when you play as other characters\n- Fixed an issue related to character color\n\nFor the full patch notes, visit https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/1710999325\n\n",
