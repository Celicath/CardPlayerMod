# CardPlayerMod

This mod adds a character named `The Card Player` to Slay the Spire. This character defies traditional style of combat, and fights with poker rules. This mod is based on a game called 'Trump Battle', created by *HSymbol* in a small game jam. It plays similarly to 'Trump Battle', but with its own twist.

# Gameplay

In addition to traditional Attack, Skill, Powers etc in the base StS game, The Card Player uses another card type: Playing Card.

## Playing Card
There are 40 cards, four suits each with numbers ranging from 1 to 10. They cost 2(1) and when you play one, it only cycles itself without doing anything. If you keep it until the end of your turn, each normal card in your hand activates its ability based on its suit.
- Spade N: Gain N Block.
- Diamond N: Deal N damage to a random enemy.
- Heart N: Heal N HP.
- Clover N: Deal N damage to all enemies.

(Suit names can be changed later.)

In addition, if your normal cards in your hand forms a [Poker Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands), effects of all normal cards are boosted.
- 1 Pair: +50%
- 2 Pairs: +100%
- Three of a kind: +150%
- Full House: +200%
- Straight: +250%
- Four of a kind: +300%
- Five of a kind: +400%
- In addition, Flush can be added to any of the above hand (including No paris too). It adds an additional +150% to the modifier.

# Compatibility
Unlike most Slay the Spire mods, Trump the Spire is not intended to be used with any other mods. Sine the majority of cards are not played in a traditional way, many relics/cards/etc added by mods will be played much differently with this character. Similarly, playing with Custom Mods are not intended.

If you want to try these, feel free to have fun. I'm going to fix crash or softlock issues, but not about balance with these enabled.
