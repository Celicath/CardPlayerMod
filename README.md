# Trump the Spire

Trump the Spire adds a character named The Trump to Slay the Spire. This character's gameplay is based on a game called 'Trump Battle', created by *HSymbol* in a small game jam. It plays similarly to 'Trump Battle', but with its own twist.

# Gameplay

There are two types of cards: Normal and Special.

## Normal
Normal cards are copied from Playing Cards. Four suits each with 10 numbers, a total of 40. They cost 2(1) and when you play one, it only cycles itself without doing anything.  At the end of your turn, each normal card in your hand activates its ability, based on its suit.
- Spade N: Gain N Block.
- Diamond N: Deal N damage to a random enemy.
- Heart N: Heal N HP.
- Clover N: Deal N damage to all enemies.

In addition, if your normal cards in your hand is forming a [Poker Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands), the effect of all normal cards are boosted.
- 1 Pair: +50%
- 2 Pairs: +100%
- Three of a kind: +150%
- Full House: +200%
- Straight: +250%
- Four of a kind: +300%
- Five of a kind: +400%

Flushes are not considered as a poker hand, and treated separately. If you have multiples of a suit, the number of all cards with that suit is increased by follows.
- 2 Same Suit: +1 each
- 3 Same Suit: +2 each
- 4 Same Suit: +3 each
- 5 Same Suit: +5 each

* Suit names can be changed later.

## Special
Special cards are similar to cards in the base game, each with their own unique abilities. Some cards are based on joker, which lets you choose a normal card from multiple cards and add to your hand, which can effectively be better normal cards. Others have direct effects like deal damage, gain Block, draw cards, etc.

# Compatibility

Unlike most Slay the Spire mods, Trump the Spire is not intended to be used with any other mods. Sine the majority of cards are not played in a traditional way, many relics/cards/etc added by mods will be played much differently with this character. Similarly, playing with Custom Mods are not intended.

If you want to try these, feel free to have fun. I'm going to fix crash or softlock issues, but not about balance with these enabled.
